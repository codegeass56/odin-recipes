# odin-recipes
This project consists of a recipe website containing links to different recipes. It is built from scratch using pure HTML.

The project is completed as part of The Odin Project online course. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate fundamental HTML skills that I have picked up over the duration of the course.

By completing this project I have demonstrated the following skills:

1. How to organize website files into appropriate directories.
2. How to write boilerplate code for any HTML file.
3. How to structure data on the webpage using elements such as paragraphs, lists and headings.
4. How to utilize links to connect different HTML files into a single website.
5. How to display and resize images.
