    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="recipe-content">
      This is my husband's favorite dish, and he considers it a special occasion
      every time I make it. The creamy cheese sauce and the tender potatoes in
      this classic French dish combine to make a deliciously addictive
      experience. It's a great side dish with a roast pork loin or beef
      tenderloin. Add a green salad and French bread, and you have found the
      magic path to a man's heart. To avoid lumps in your sauce, add the milk
      just a little at a time as you stir the flour and butter. Experiment with
      different cheeses for variety.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="recipe-content">
      <li>4 russet potatoes, sliced into &frac14; inch slices</li>
      <li>1 onion, sliced into rings</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>&frac12; teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>1&frac12; cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="recipe-content">
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a medium casserole
        dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer 1/2 of the potatoes into bottom of the prepared casserole dish.
        Top with the onion slices, and add the remaining potatoes. Season with
        salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium-size saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Mix in the
        flour and salt, and stir constantly with a whisk for one minute. Stir in
        milk. Cook until mixture has thickened. Stir in cheese all at once, and
        continue stirring until melted, about 30 to 60 seconds. Pour cheese over
        the potatoes, and cover the dish with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>Bake 1&frac12; hours in the preheated oven.</li>
